## PBSmodelling: GUI tools made easy ##

**PBSmodelling** provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical user interface (GUI). Although it depends heavily on the R interface to the **Tcl/Tk** package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The package contains examples that illustrate models built with other R packages, including **PBSmapping**, **deSolve**, **PBSddesolve**, and **BRugs**. 

This site assists developers in tracking and resolving bugs and other issues. Users of **PBSmodelling** should obtain the current release from standard R repositories, such as <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBSmodelling/index.html">CRAN</a>.
