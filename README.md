## PBSmodelling: GUI tools made easy ##
&copy; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2005-2024)

**PBSmodelling** provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical user interface (GUI). Although it depends heavily on the R interface to the **Tcl/Tk** package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The package contains examples that illustrate models built with other R packages, including **PBSmapping**, **deSolve**, **PBSddesolve**, and **BRugs**. 

This site assists developers in tracking and resolving bugs and other issues. Users of **PBSmodelling** should obtain the current release from standard R repositories, such as <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PBSmodelling">CRAN</a>.

**PBSmodelling** represents just one of a series of R packages developed at the Pacific Biological Station (<a href="http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/index-eng.html#pbs">PBS</a>) in Nanaimo, British Columbia. A more advanced version of **PBSmodelling** might be available at <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software">pbs-software on GitHub</a>. Any evolving package (Windows binary and source tarball) is built after using CRAN's rigorous `R CMD check --as-cran` routine (on a Windows 7 64-bit system) and posted to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2Bkic2Qu5LGOGx1WkRySVYxNFU?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>. Most of the time, the revision on <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-modelling">GitHub</a> can be built in R using `devtools::install_github("pbs-software/pbs-modelling/PBSmodelling")`; however, not every revision has been checked for CRAN worthiness.
