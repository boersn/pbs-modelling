# PBSmodelling #

**PBSmodelling** provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation  of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to  construct and edit a customized graphical user interface (GUI). Although it  depends heavily on the R interface to the **Tcl/Tk** package, a user does not need  to know `Tcl/Tk`. The package contains examples that illustrate models built with  other R packages, including **PBSmapping**, **deSolve**, **PBSddesolve**, and **BRugs**.

This site assists developers in tracking and resolving bugs and other issues. Users of **PBSmodelling** should obtain the current release from standard R repositories, such as CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/).
